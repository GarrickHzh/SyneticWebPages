            <p class="info-p">With Jeep Gladiator, some vehicles already come with existing deck rails on both sides of
                the truck bed, even if yours do not we have you covered, just send us a message requesting to purchase a
                set of them.</p>

            <p class="info-p">The deck rails are absolutely necessary for our Gladiator tonneau cover to be installed,
                there will be some special rails we call Adapters to make use of the deck rails in the process. As far
                as the installation for those deck rails goes, everything is fairly simple, you just put them on, add
                those screws, washers and you are all set! What is special about Gladiator is that the cover makes use
                of 3 sets of rails throughout; the original deck rail, the adapter rail, and the cover's own railing
                system. Even though it may seem a little overwhelming at first, rest assure the final looks of
                everything won't disappoint you one bit!</p>
